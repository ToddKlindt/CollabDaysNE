Let's write a PowerShell function called Add-ClientCredential. It has 4 parameters, tenantname, username, password, and testcredential. It should use Add-PnPStoredCredential to store credentials for https://tenant.sharepoint.com, https://tenant.sharepoint.com/, and https://tenant-admin.sharepoint.com.

Looks good. Let's have it prompt the user if they don't enter tenantname, username, or password. And let's have the password take a securestring instead of a string

Looks good. Add a check to make sure the pnp.powershell in installed. If not, tell the user and give them the line to install it.

If the script finds and existing credential, show the username for that credential

Looks great! Please add a description and provide a few examples.

Add support if the user enters contoso.sharepoint.com, contoso.onmicrosoft.com, https, or http versions of them

This all works great. Is there anything else I should add, or any other errors I should trap for?

Good ideas. Add validation for tenant name format and error handling for pnp cmdlets
